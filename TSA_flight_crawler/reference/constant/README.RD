"airport_codelist.json" is all 679 US airport code
"sublist1.json" and "sublist2.json" are two subset of 679 US airport code.
sublist1 + sublist2 = all 679 US airport.

I divided them by flight number. Thus the total flight number in sublist1 and sublist2 are very close.
Then we can use 2 crawler to crawl them.
